step 1: 
make sure to install all the tensorflow and tensorflow related libraries
listed in the code. 

step2:
make sure to install cv2 for image manipulation and in the case you get 
an error, open the c-command prompt and run:  conda install openCV-python 
or pip install openCV-python. make sure to install these from the correct root or directory in
your local drive

step3:
make sure to read both the training and test images from the correct path.
here is an example:

trainpath = "C:\\Users\\abukar\\DeepLearning_ProJect\\test"
testpath  = "C:\\Users\\abukar\\DeepLearning_ProJect\\train"

step4:
from here you should be able to read sample image, impliment the model and then
do the training and testing etc,
